1. When does the tenure of the internship start?
 We have already started the first week assignments are already provided. The purpose of the internship 
is to work in a collaborative work environment just like in a office. When you join a company you are expected to learn
and contribute to the project. This is not a classroom environment. It may be initially challenging but the whole purpose
is to take that fear out and make you job ready. Once you go through this you will have great deal of confidence to work 
professionally. It ends by December 18th, by which time hopefully you will have job offers etc. 

2. Can we carry on our work sitting from home/college?
   I see no reason why you cannot. In this day and age we should be able to work collaboratively over the internet and cloud. 
I would also encourage you to take up the free virtual machines that amazon and google clouds are giving. All you need is a
credit card. they will not charge you, they just need that for verification. 
Only challenge that you will have working from home/college is the focus. You might get distracted. Please see if you 
can figure that part out. 

3.Will I get certificate of internship?

Yes you will, As i stated in the offer also. the certificate of merit in internship provides a judgement of how well you did. 
In addition to that i will be writing a recommendataion highlighing your code and key insights for the prospective employer.Our purpose is to get you job in/through our organization by the time intership ends or may be even in a few months following that. 

4. After successful completion of internship, what areas of this field will I get mastery?

As we said briefly, there are three main job roles in the industry today at entry level. You should expect good mastery
in the areas mentioned below once you decide which area you want to pursue. As i said this is not a class, this is a simulated work environment, where you are actually solving problems. 

Security Management : ( SOC engineer, Cyber Security Jobs, Cyber Security Engineer, Analyst, Forensics) 
Security Testinng : ( Penetration Testing, Fuzing, Taint Analysis, Malware Reversing, Load testing, Exploits)
Securit Developer : ( secure code development in Java, C, Python, Scala)

I will make a folder here and start to demonstrate the job expecatations of diferent jobs out there. 

As far as i could tell the applicants look more comfortable in security management. Some people in the group will also be doingsecure coding and testing. The sooner you can decide which group you will want to be in, that will help. I would encourage everybody to start with week 1 activities and see what you like, what is easy or hard for you. Again the assignments are at different levels, some people will complete basic, some will do advanced and some will solve reseaerch problems like the one mentioend in week1. So, placement also will depend on the capability. But sometimes one also learns from oberving others. In my 23+ years of experience i have seen thousands of engineers with same fears, believe me all this will vanish once you apply your mind and solve problems. 

5. Can I come to bangalore office in last 30 days and work there?

Sure, You are most welcome to come over. We can absorb about 50 people in our office. But do let me know in advance. 
For some of you i might call you earlier if jobs come looking for you faster. There are a lot of potential waiting for you 
to finish your work in the internship and they would love to put you in projects. I guess a better time to come would be when
we can set up your meetings with customers. 

6. I am uncomfortable with programming. Will I be able to contribute?

I would suggest that you take a interest in those activities where you are testing or in security management. 
Even there would be programming but very light weight. For example you look at week 1 activities. there is very basic 
shell programming to automate some sysadmin jobs. If you are not developing, then you got to become a good testor OR security 
administrator. It may be better to overcome the fear of programming now

**Security is a branch of computer science**
Overall you can still get jobs, but progress may be slow without programming knowledge
Eventually you can develop managerial skills and take it from there.
